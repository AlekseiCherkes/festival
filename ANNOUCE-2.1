        The Festival Speech Synthesis System version 2.1
         and Edinburgh Speech Tools Library version 2.1
                        November 2010

Surprisingly we have a new release.  Please give feedback for
installation issues so they can be fixed in a 2.1 release.

Festival offers a general framework for building speech synthesis
systems as well as including examples of various modules.  As a whole
it offers full text to speech through a number APIs: from shell level,
though a Scheme command interpreter, as a C++ library, from Java, and
an Emacs interface.  Festival is multi-lingual (currently English
(British and American), and Spanish) though English is the most
advanced.  Other groups release new languages for the system.  And
full tools and documentation for build new voices are available
through Carnegie Mellon's FestVox project (http://festvox.org).  This
version also supports voices built with the latest version of Nagoya
Institute of Technologies' HTS system (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp)

The system is written in C++ and uses the Edinburgh Speech Tools
Library for low level architecture and has a Scheme (SIOD) based
command interpreter for control.  Documentation is given in the FSF
texinfo format which can generate, a printed manual, info files and
HTML.

Festival is free software.  Festival and the speech tools are
distributed under an X11-type licence allowing unrestricted commercial
and non-commercial use alike.

This distribution includes:
   * Full English (British and American English) text to speech
   * Full C++ source for modules, SIOD interpreter, and Scheme library
   * Lexicon based on CMULEX and OALD (OALD is restricted to non-commercial
